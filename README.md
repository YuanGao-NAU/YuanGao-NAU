👨‍💻 I've spent a good amount of time woking on back-end engineering, mostly building features and taking care of architectures for server-side products and enterprise software.

### 🏢 Work experience

🌏 I used to be an SWE at **[National supercomputing center in Wuxi(国家超级计算无锡中心)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunway_TaihuLight)**, which has one of the most powerful super computer around the world. I participanted in the design of the operator library called **[OpenArray](https://github.com/hxmhuang/OpenArray_Dev)** by using C/C++ and Fortran. You may found a paper published **[here](https://www.geosci-model-dev.net/12/4729/2019/gmd-12-4729-2019.html)**.

### 🧩 Most Recent Project

💚 My recent project was a website call [EcoPAD](https://ecolab.nau.edu/ecopad/) aims to automate the workflow of ecological forecasting. We are now able to do 7-day near term ecological forecasting in two sites owned by own collaborators with this platform.
